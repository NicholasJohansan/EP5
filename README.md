EP5 is a discord bot made mainly to entertain me and my friends,
its sole purpose was for me to improve on an older bot of mine and
learn new libraries such as pymongo and asyncio. It was also created
so I can regularly practice programming while working on something
I find fun.

Throughout making this bot, I learnt various things such as,
performing database operations with mongodb, using heroku as a PaaS,
as well as other libraries. Besides, this also helped me better
understand the filesystem of a project and how to structure a project.
