# Price Change
[Back to Items Commands](https://github.com/NicholasJohansan/EP5#items)

Checks with the price update loop, which stores a new "last run" time everytime it executes, for the last run time.\
It then takes that time and add 15mins to it, and subtracts the time now from the calculated time.\
Afterwards, it formats the time in seconds into more user-friendly words.

## Usage

`!price_change`\
Returns an approximate time to the next price change
